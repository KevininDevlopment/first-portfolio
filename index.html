    <h1>Greetings</h1>
    <p>I am currently a student at Rasmussen's school of technology. I have been requested to create this web page in order to work on HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the hopes that I will become a better developer. Truly, creating this website gives me much joy, and I can really appreciate the combined knowledge neccessary to create a fully functioning website. There are different sections to the site and each section decribes a new area of information. I'm very pleased with my site so tell me what ya think!</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>Although I'm currently a student, I am still trying to attain an entry-level position as a Jr. web developer or software engineer. With the above being mentioned, I do belive that I can be an asset on any development team. If I am not familiar with the technology that is being used I will usually be able to learn it within a short time period. Wether a coding framework or an exact language, or even minor attributes that are often seen in programming, I will usually be able to fulfill my employer's desires. </p>
