    <h1>Career</h1>
    <p>As listed on my homepage, I am searching for an entry position into the tech industry as a Jr. web developer or software engineer. I do not have a list of employers whom I wish to contact after my studies, but I am available for the industry. This
      means, that I am available for projects which can entail the details of either position. I would also try my best to assist independent business owners by taking on freelancing projects. If you are reading this and would like to inquire about possible
      freelancing work then please view my contact page for more details on how to reach me.</p>

    <h2>Job Market</h2>
    <p>The job market for web developers is perhpas at the highest it has ever been in terms of employment. Certain surveys conducted on the tech industry show that there are over one million new tech workers needed to fill empty positions. These roles, however, are not being filled due to a lack of qualified programmers. Upon researching which degree program I should enroll in, I viewed the statistics for Web Programmers. Our field is expected to grow by 27% until the year 2024. My expected graduation date is in the month of December, 2018, so I should be graduating into a pristine job market.</p>
