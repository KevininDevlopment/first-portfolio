  <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
  <p>Hobbies are very important, as it is always needed to take a break from strenuos activities. Some of my hobbies include video games, researching different software, exercising, and meeting new people.</p>

      <h2>Hobby Time</h2>
      <p>I usually have a certain time in the day that I set aside for my hobbies. At times I may take a break from everyday activities by going out to the mall and speaking with other shoppers, or even watching a new movie, in a movie theatre. This way I can meet others who enjoy the same types of movies I do. I usually find that it is best to experience new movies where I can order food to be catered to me. Among other hobbies, I try to keep up with the latest video games released into the market, so I often check stores like "Best Buy" or "Game Stop" to view new releases.</p>
      <p>I also try my best to view relevant software, most of it is open-source. I am currently interested in software such as the "Metasploit GUI", however, in order to purchase this type of program it can cost in excess of $5,000.00. Other interests of mine include Red Hat Linux, new laptops, and computer accessories. </p>
