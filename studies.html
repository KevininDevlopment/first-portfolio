  <h1>Studies</h1>
  <p>Currently, I am studying to attain a Web Programming A.S. from Rasmussen college. The core studies include OOP (Object Oriented Programming) software design, website development, and developing software applications for mobile phones. I am a full-time student and I am expected to graduate the month of December, 2018. However, I have been studying programming for a little over two years now, and my experience with coding is not limited to the studies of the college I attend. I beleive that I have enough experience to develop websites professionally, but I'm certain that rasmussen will perfect my craft.</p>
