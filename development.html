    <h1>Development</h1>
    <p>Here is where I can discuss things like improving on creating new software, programming languages I would like to study, and even mastering languages that I currently code in. In order for me to develop my coding abilities I must make certain to work
      regularly on projects. </p>

  <div>
    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>At this time I am familiar with many programming languages, and I have written many simple scripts as well. Some of these scripts were written in languages such as Python, Ruby, Javascript, and even Bash. I must say that I have more expertise in the
      scripting high-end languages, and I do rather prefer them. Although, I still have the ability to code in languages that must be compiled, like C# and Java, for instance, but I must say that they are rather basic projects.</p>
    <p>To add, I would not be much of a web developer if I was not familiar with some back-end language frameworks, so I will share a bit more. Currently, I know how to work with frameworks like Rails, Flask, Django, and I have much experience with SQL databases
      like MySQL, MongoDB, etc.. Also, I have programmed with Javascript libraries like React, Jquery, and AJAX. I will also be taking up Node.Js, Gulp, and other classes, as I will strive to become a full-stack Javascript developer so that I may have
      additional, employable development experience.
